## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Variable font sizes via the clamp() CSS function

### What I learned

Getting the font size to adjust based on the viewport size _without_ using a
media query was a challenge. I remembered the existence of the `clamp()` function,
but was having all kinds of trouble getting it to work as I wanted. Then I
stumbled across the clamp generator listed below in the Resources section. That
site was immensely helpful getting working values.

### Continued development

Still having a little trouble with spacing and alignment of various elements,
but that'll come with practice.

### Useful resources

- [Clamp Generator](https://www.mcneece.com/clamp-generator/) - This helped me get the clamp() values for the font size to adjust based on viewport size.
- [MDN Box Shadow Generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_backgrounds_and_borders/Box-shadow_generator) - This is avery useful tool on the MDN site. It helps visualize box shadows based on various values, updating in real time as values are adjusted.
